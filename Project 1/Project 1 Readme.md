### <u>SAT & ACT Participation rates : 2017 & 2018</u>

### Introduction:

SAT and ACT are two of the most popular college entrance tests in the US and around the world. For the first project, the data containing the participation rates by each state in the country and their average subject scores are provided. Using Python, the 2017 and 2018 data (in .csv format) will be imported and tidied up in order to visualize and draw some inference from the data for SAT to invest to improve their overall participation rate.

From the data provided, it is clear that ACT has commanding lead when it comes to participation rates compared to the SAT. However, SAT participation rates is climbing up from 2017 to 2018 and we are able to identify an area of investment to improve the participation rates and to catch up to ACT.

### Trends analysis:

Seperating the data given into <u>two categories of data</u>, the **participation rates** and the **mean scores for each test** and their subjects, it is clear that there are patterns for each category. For the participation rates, the **participation rates by each state varies greatly**, where there are many occurences of a full participation (100%) or an extremely low participation (<10%).The main difference between the SAT and ACT participation distribution is that the ACT has a more counts of a high participation rate.

As for the scores, the main focus would be on the total or composite score for each tests for a more comparable result. Two interesting observations can be made, which provides a bit more insight into the participating population. Firstly, it is observed that there may be **two or more groups within the population** as 'twin peaks' are clearly observed when plotting on a histogram for the occurrence of scores. The second observation from the linear regression plot, is that there is an **inverse correlation between the scores for both tests**, where a high score for one test will be observed alongside a low score in the other test.

### Inferences:

Based on the trends, we can infer on how the participating population behaves with regards to the tests. The first being that based on the scatter plots between the participation rates between both tests, most **students will only take either one of the tests**, with only a couple of states having high participation in both tests and none with full participation in both tests. We can deduce that the students will only take on average, one of the test. 

The other trend that is observed would be that there is an **negative relationship between the scores obtained and the participation rate**. For the states of Colorado and Illinois, which had the biggest change in participation rates for both tests, the scores and participation rate for each test swung the opposite of each other. The state of Florida also exhibited this trend, where they had a decrease in participation for both tests, but a corresponding increase in both scores.

When observing for the greatest change in participation rate for all the states, the most prominent  states would be Colorado and Illinois, which went from a SAT participation rate of around 10% to 100% participation, and 80% corresponding drop in ACT participation. The only explanation that would explain this swing would be that there is some intervention on the state level, where it changed the compulsory attendance for the ACT to the SAT.

### Conclusions & Recommendations:

While several trends and inferences can be made, the **data provided is not sufficient enough** to provide enough information about each individual student, as the data provided are summary statistics for each state. Providing the scores for each individual student's scores could answer whether there are different 'groups' of students and whether there are students taking both tests. The data also does not provide any information about the total number of participants and non-participants, which would be important to have a fuller picture about the population.

Based on the information provided, we can observe that in order to continue this increase in participation rate in SAT, it would be recommended that more effort should be invested encourage **state education boards to adopt and support SAT** as the compulsory or recommended aptitude test. When pitching to the states, it would also be recommended to minimise the mentioning of the average score as it may leave a negative impression.
